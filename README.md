- 👋 Hi, I’m @Juliett-Lima
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about GitHub, containers and CI/CD. And Go (lang) and maybe Ruby.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the go language and want to also try it out with the Adabas community edition.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I am not having strong interests I would be able to name here.
- 📫 How to reach me ... not so much currently.

A bit more of my background
- I am a senior IT professional (Sr. Dir. Product Management) since 1993
- Especially as I am an IT professional and left RnD for the management role since so long, it is important for me to keep up-to-date
- Also to keep the feet on the ground - knowing about what engineers are talking about
- I have a computer scientists degree from Technical University of Darmstadt / Germany
- I am here for private reasons, though
- I was always interested in programming languages and their concepts
- Languages I used to be very familiar with are: C, C++, Objective-C, Smalltalk, Java, PROLOG, PERL
- I created professional software the large scale with C++ and Java
- Although I wrote super efficient PERL scripts to support everyday development tasks, I dislike languages that can't be recognized by me after 2 weeks anymore.
- I needI/prefer it more human-readable and understandable
- And I started to love OO (object orientation) looong ago, actually ∼ 1993
- I never really made it into functional programming - except for what PROLOG had
- In the last decades I also played with Python, although I have to say it appears to be just a bot fo a better PERL to me.
- I heard about go as an engineer said to me: "Go fits better to us C programmers than Java.".
- That's why I want to judge go. And I meanwhile can understand it (after having written an LL(2) recursive descent scanner/parser for a proprietary query language).
- I never had compilers as a subject during my studies. But back then, I read Niklaus Wirth's book back and forth and so the dragon book some years later.
- I think that's it for now

Let's see how the journey goes...
